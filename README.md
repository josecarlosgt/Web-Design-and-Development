## Skills
- Apply the planning, analysis, and design phases of the SDLC for the creation of websites
- Structure content using standard HTML tags
- Improve the structure of HTML code for search engines by implementing HTML5 semantics  

Each task below provides links that explain the purpose of each HTML tag. These links point to two popular learning resources on web development:

- [Mozilla MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). This website contains detailed and up-to-date documentation on HTML.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) This website contains examples and brief explanations of HTML.

 On-page Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techiniques require a list of keywords that describe the most relevant and significant aspects of your website. Here are some examples:
- Laguna Brava
- Ecotourism
- Nature
- Adventure

We will use the following text. Note the keywords are highlighted in bold.

> *Lake description*  
> **Laguna Brava** is a karstic lake of incomparable beauty located in western Guatemala. **Laguna Brava** is located in a remote and highly underdeveloped region, so reaching and exploring the lake takes a mix of extreme **adventure** and intimate contact with **nature**. The lake beauty lies in the colours variety of its waters, which depends on the sun's position. **Laguna Brava** is also known as Yolnabaj by the region's inhabitants, which translates as "rough lake". Despite its name, the waters of **Laguna Brava** Laguna are so calm that they instantly awaken a deep feeling of peace.
>
> *Description of the local communities*  
> Members of the communities settled around **Laguna Brava** welcome travelers from all regions of the world looking for **adventure** and **nature**. They believe that visitors and responsible **ecotourism** practices are essential to support the development of their communities.

>
> *Description of activities*  
> The communities offer two options for guided visits that allow visitors to enjoy **Laguna Brava's** natural beauty. In both options, they provide life vests and local guides who know the lake very well to take care of your safety.
>
> *Guided visits options*
>
> *Option 1*  
> The Lake Challenge  
> Cross the four kilometres in a kayak guided by a local guide. This guided visit is physically demanding, and it is recommended for only those in excellent physical condition.
> - Duration: 5 hours approx.
> - Price: $50 USD
> - Minimum: 2 pax
>
> *Option 2*  
> Sit Back & Relax  
> Board a rowing boat that takes to around the most beautiful parts of the lake. This guided visit does not require physical effort.
> - Duration: 5 hours approx.
> - Price: 3 hours approx.
> - Minimum: 4 pax

## Task 1: Creating the basic structure

Fill in the \<title\> element with a descriptive title and specify UTF-8 as the character encoding set (charset) using the meta tag.
Recall this title will appear on the browser's window or tab.

```html
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Laguna Brava Ecotourism</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Task 2: Adding the main headline

Inside the body element, create the main heading. Use the [level 1 heading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) (\<h1\>) element.

```html
<h1>Welcome to Laguna Brava Ecotourism</h1>
```

## Task 3: Adding sub-headings and paragraphs
Structure the content above using [paragraph elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p) and level 2 headings.

You can follow the structure below:

```html
<!-- lake description -->
<h1>Welcome to Laguna Brava Ecotourism</h1>
<p>
    ...
</p>
```

```html
<!-- business/organization description -->
<h2>The Local Communities</h2>
<p>
    ...
</p>
```

```html
<!-- activities description -->
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>
    ...
</p>
```

```html
<!-- Option 1 -->
<h3>The Lake Challenge</h3>
<p>
    ...
</p>
<!-- Option 2 -->
<h3>Sit Back & Relax</h3>
<p>
    ...
</p>
```

## Task 4: Adding lists
Each guided visit option contains details organized as a list (e.g., price and minimum number of people). Use the [unordered list element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) to structure this information, right below the sub-heading in each option.

```html
<h3>The Lake Challenge</h3>
<p>
...
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Duration: 5 hours approx.</li>
    <li>Price: $50 USD</li>
    <li>Minimum: 2 pax</li>
</ul>
            
```

```html
<h3>Sit Back & Relax</h3>
<p>
...
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Duration: 3 hours approx.</li>
    <li>Price: $40 USD</li>
    <li>Minimum: 4 pax</li>
</ul>
```

## Task 5: Adding links
Choose at least three words or phrases and make them a hyperlink (link) using the [anchor element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a).

Specify the URL of another website using the hyperlink reference (href) attribute of the anchor element. HTML attributes are commonly used in HTML to provide additional information and control the content within an HTML tag.

```html
Laguna Brava is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst">karstic lake</a> of incomparable beauty located in western Guatemala.
```

Notes:
- The link allows the viewer of the page to click on it and jump into the referring or target page. When this happens, you may realize that the target page opens in the same browser window.
- You may also look at how to make the hyperlink to open the target page in a browser tab or window.

## Task 6: Adding images
Add a few images using the [image element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img). Specify the URL of the image in the source (src) property of the \<img\> tag. 

We will use local images, which means the server will host these images. Create an *img/* in the same folder containing your *index.html* document and add the images to be included in each image tag below.

Place the image before the level 1 heading created in task 2.

```html
<img src="img/panoramic-laguna-brava-2.jpg" alt="Laguna Brava lake" title="Laguna Brava">
<h1>...</h1>
```

> Download the header image from [here](https://github.com/josecarlosgt/Web-Design-and-Development/raw/tutorial-2-designing-and-structuring-content/img/panoramic-laguna-brava-2.jpg)

 Then, add an image in each option of the guided visit. Place each image right below the sub-heading in each option (before the description text).

 ```html
<h3>The Lake Challenge</h3>
<img src="img/kayak.jpg" alt="Lake challenge kayak" title="Kayak on Laguna Brava">
<p>
    ...            
</p>

<h3>Sit Back & Relax</h3>
<img src="img/boat.jpg" alt="Sit Back & Relax boat" title="Boat trip">
<p>
    ...            
</p>
```

> Download these images from here: [kayak image](https://josecarlosgt.github.io/Web-Design-and-Development/img/kayak.jpg) and [boat image](https://josecarlosgt.github.io/Web-Design-and-Development/img/boat.jpg) 

Notes:
- The image element does not require a closing tag because this element does not enclose any content. All the information required to display an image is specified as attributes of the image element.
- To make the \<img\> tag work, you need to add an image file and make it accessible from the folder where your index.html is located. Developers usually create an image folder named "img" or "images" that contains all the images displayed on a website. The image URL can be a relative path, e.g., "images/myimage.jpg", which means the image is served locally or an absolute path, e.g., https://josecarlosgt.github.io/Web-Design-and-Development/img/kayak.jpg, which means the image is served externally by another web server.
- You can also use the title attribute to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

## Task 7: Adding a web form
After the last paragraph, create a web form that requests comments from your page's viewer based on their experiences to Laguna Brava (if any). Web forms are useful for capturing information from users.

A web form consists of a form ([\<form\>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)) element and a combination of input elements and other elements that allow the user to enter different types of data. Visit these sites to learn more about how to create web forms.

- [Form element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp)
- [HTML input types](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp)
- [Label element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label)

Use the [break line element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br) to produces a line break in text (carriage-return) as necessary to separate each group of elements.

```html
<br>
```

Create a text input field to capture the user's name:
```html
<label for="name">Name: </label>
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Write your name">
```

Create an email input field to capture the user's email:
```html
<label for="email">Email: </label>
<input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="Write your email">
```

Use the [line break element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br) to display each label/input pair in your form in a single line:
```html
<label for="name">Name: </label>
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Write your name"><br><br>
...
```

Create a [textarea](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea) field to capture the users' comment:
```html
<label for="experience">Experience: </label>
<textarea name="experience" id="experience" placeholder="Please share with us your experience." rows="5" cols="50"></textarea>
```

Create a submit input field to display a submit button:
```html
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
```    

Notes:
- Notice the difference between the text and email fields
- The name attribute in the input and textarea elements is useful for managing the data entered by the user in server-side programs. We will ignore this attribute for now, since we are focusing only on developing the front-end of a webpage, i.e., the code that runs in the client (web browser).
- Notice how adding [label elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) and the [placeholder attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_placeholder.asp) to your input text and textarea fields improve the usability of your form.
- Notice how the id attribute of the input fields relates to the for attribute of the label element.
 
Use the [horizontal rule element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) to separate the form from the rest of the content in the webpage.

```html
<hr>
```

Note that the line break and horizontal rule elements (as well as the \<input\> and \<img\>) elements do not require a closing tag because these elements do not enclose any content. 

Finally, add a comment on top of the form element to state the purpose of your form using the syntax <!--  -->. Comments in HTML are not displayed to the user of the page. The purpose of comments is to explain your code, which can help you or help others to edit the source code at a later date.

```html
<!-- A form asking for page viewer's experiences -->
```

## Task 8: Make your Web page HTML5
Let's improve the structure of your website by leveraging HTML5 features.

[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5) is the current specification of HTML. HTML5 introduces standards designed to facilitate the development of modern web applications and websites.

One of the main improvements introduced by HTML5 is a new set of semantic elements. The term [semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) refers to the meaning of a given element. Through new semantic elements, HTML5 allows web developers to describe more precisely what the content of a web page is.

The benefits of using semantic elements include:
- It allows search engines to identify relevant content on the web page, influencing the page's search rankings.
- Screen readers can use semantic elements as signposts to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
- Semantic elements also contribute to the purpose of HTML to represent content based on its structure and not on presentation (style). Presentation (i.e., how a web page should look) is the sole responsibility of CSS.
 
**The HTML5 document type declaration**

A Document Type Declaration (doctype) is an instruction to the web browser about the version of HTML in which a web page is written. Every HTML document requires a valid document type declaration to ensure that the web pages on your website are displayed the way they are intended to be displayed.

The doctype for HTML5 is very short, concise, and case-insensitive. Add the following line to the top of your index.html file to declare it as an HTML5 document.

```html
<!doctype html>
```

Many HTML semantic tags are *sectioning* elements because they create logical sections. This means they group content that is semantically related. Popular examples include:
- header
- main
- footer
- nav
- article
- section
- figure
- aside

Notes:
- The doctype declaration is usually the very first thing defined in an HTML document (even before the opening \<html\>tag); however, the doctype declaration itself is not an HTML tag.

## Task 9: Adding semantic tags (header, main, and footer)
In this task, you will be adding some of the most popular semantic tags introduced by HTML5.

[header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header): represents introductory content and navigational aids. It may contain  heading elements, a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

Use this element to enclose the lake image, the main heading, and the introductory paragraph about the lake:

```html
<header><!-- Introductory content -->            
    <img src="img/panoramic-laguna-brava-2.jpg" width="1500" height="500" alt="Laguna Brava lake">
    <h1>Welcome to Laguna Brava Ecotourism</h1>
    <p>
        Laguna Brava is a ...
    </p>
</header>
```

A popular semantic tag that often lives insider the \<header\> element is \<nav\>. [nav](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. We will use this element in a different tutorial.

[main](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main): represents the dominant or primary content of a web document. This content should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be included here. 

Enclose the rest of your content in a main element:

```html
<main><!-- Dominant content of the web page -->
    ...
</main>
```

[footer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer): It typically contains copyright data or links to related documents.

Add a copyright notice at the bottom of the HTML document using the \<footer\> element right before the closing tag of the \<body\> element.

```html
<footer><!-- Defines a footer for a document or section -->
    &copy; 2022 Laguna Brava Ecotourism
</footer>
```

Notes:
- It is essential to understand the meaning of each semantic element and how these elements structure your web page's content in a way that is more representative of its content.
- Although the structure of your web document represents the meaning of each piece of content better, it has not changed or improved the appearance of the webpage. To improve the appearance of a webpage to its visitors, you will use another technology different from HTML, namely CSS. CSS is the topic of the next tutorial.

## Task 10: Structuring content using articles

[article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article): represents self-contained content. This means \<article\> content could be removed from the page and put on other pages and still make sense on its own. Thus, content inside an \<article\> element should be intended to be independently distributable or reusable. Content inside \<article\> is also intended to change often (e.g., online publications such as blogs, magazine articles, and event listings). Thus, this tag tells search engines the content it contains changes often and put more weight on the text it contains compared to other site elements.

Each \<article\> should be identified, typically by including a heading as a child of the \<article\> element.  

What content would you consider to structure as articles? The guided visit options are a good candidate:

```html
<article><!-- Self-contained content intended to be independently distributable -->
    <h3>...</h3>
    <img ...>   
    ...
    <ul>...</ul>
</article>
```

## Task 11: Structuring content using sections

[section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section): represents a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it like \<main\>, \<nav\>, or \<aside\>. 

Use the section element to enclose the headings and content of each section of the web page: the local communities and activities sections. 

Notes:
- Although it might behaver similar to the \<article\> element, if the contents of the element represent a standalone unit of content that makes sense by itself (e.g., a blog post or blog comment, or a newspaper article), the \<article\> element should be used instead.
- If you are only using the element as a styling wrapper, use \<div\> instead. As a sectioning element, a rule of thumb is that content inside \<section\> should be logically related.
- Sections usually have a heading element as a child
- Sections can exist inside articles to group semantically connected content inside an article or other elements
- Section can also be used to group semantically related article elements

> The advantage is that each section can have its separate HTML heading. This can give search engines a better understanding of how the web page is segmented and structured. Search engines might be able to interpret the information hierarchy of the HTML document based on \<section\> tags.

Reference: [HTML5 Elements That Can Affect Search Engine Indexing](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/what-potential-impact-can-html5-have-on-seo/)

## Task 12: Highlithing text importance
In addition to the sectioning tags mentioned above, you can also use other elements to highlight important text, such as:

The [emphasis element \(em\)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em): represent words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text. It is often limited to a word or a few words.

Choose a word or words in your content that you think should be emphasized. For example, you can emphasize the words "responsible ecotourism practices" in the sentence: "They believe that visitors and responsible ecotourism practices are essential to support the development of their communities.":

```html
<em>responsible ecotourism practices</em>
```

The [strong element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong): element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.

Choose sentences in your content that you think should be marked as serious or urgent. For example, statements about safety and the requirement of excellent physical condition for the first option of guided visits:

```html
<strong>they provide life vests and local guides who know the lake very well to take care of your safety.</strong>
```

And,

```html
<strong>This guided visit is physically demanding, and we recommend it for only those in excellent physical condition.</strong>
```

These elements are preferred instead of the once glorious but now less popular [\<b\>](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_b.asp) and [\<i\>](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_i.asp) tags.

 ## Task 13 Adding the figure element 
 
Use the [figure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure) element with a caption to structure the content related to the image in each activity. Use the description of the activity as the caption of figure:

```html
<figure>
    <img src="..."
         alt="...">
    <figcaption>[Activity description]</figcaption>
</figure>
```

> The figure element groups together related content, contributing to the meaning (semantics) of the HTML document when compared to the image tag.

## Task 14: Adding on-page SEO

Check your content against the following recommendations to improve SEO:
1. Use \<title\> with descriptive text (i.e., text contains at least one keyword)
2. Include keywords in your headings elements
3. Repeat keywords in the web page text
4. Use the alt attribute of image elements
5. Provide a description using the [meta tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp). Make sure you also include your keywords in the description:

```html
<meta name="description" content=" Laguna Brava Ecotourism is a local adventure company based in Laguna Brava." />
```

As mentioned in task 7, the use of semantic tags (task 8) also contributes to [improving SEO](https://resources.bayshoresolutions.com/blog/html5-boosts-seo-strategy/).

You may also visit the page [How Search organizes information](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/crawling-indexing/) to get a basic understanding of how Google's Search service works.

## Task 15: Adding side content
Use the [aside semantic element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside) to enclose the content related to the form:

```html
<hr>	        
<aside><!-- Defines content aside from the content it is placed in -->
    ...    
    <!-- A form asking for page viewer's experiences -->	
    <form>
        ...
    </form>
</aside>
```

> The \<aside\> HTML element represents tangential information or content indirectly related to the document's central theme, such as sidebars or callout boxes.

The [index.html](./index.html) file contains the final HTML document. *Compare the structure of your HTML document using traditional HTML elements (paragraphs) versus HTML5 semantic elements.*
